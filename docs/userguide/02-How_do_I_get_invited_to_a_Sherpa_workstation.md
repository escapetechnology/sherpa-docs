# How do I get invited to a Sherpa workstation?

There will be an administrator for your Sherpa project. They will be able to invite you to a workstation. You will need to tell the following.

1. The **email address** you used when signing up to Sherpa.
2. Your IP address. You can find this out by going to <https://www.whatsmyip.org/> or similar website.

You will need to accept the invite before you can proceed.
