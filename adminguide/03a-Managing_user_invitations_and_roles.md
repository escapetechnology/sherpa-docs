# Managing user's invitations and project roles

## Reviewing current users

It is wise to review the users associated with your project on a regular basis. This can be done by selecting **Users** in the dropdown on the **Project Details** page:

![Users in project details](/images/users_in_project_details.png)

Doing so will reveal a list of users associated with the project:

Selecting a user will reveal the roles the user has on a project and the workstations the user has been invited to:

## Removing a user

If you want to remove a user completely from a project you need to remember to remove the user's access to the resource/workstation and the group/project role.
