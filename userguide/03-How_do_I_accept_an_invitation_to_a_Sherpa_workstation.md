# How do I accept an invitation to a Sherpa workstation?
When a Sherpa administrator invites you to a workstation you will be sent an email. You can accept the invite using the link in the email or you can log into your Sherpa account.

If you log into your Sherpa account you will see any outstanding invites on your dashboard.
