# Where do I find the shared storage?
When a Sherpa project is initially built the shared storage will be mapped as the **F:/** drive on a Windows box and **/mnt/assets** on a Linux machine.
 
Your Sherpa admin may have configured your setup differently to match say existing work practices. In which case the shared storage may be somewhere else. If in doubt, please talk to your Sherpa admin.
