## Connecting to your workstation for the first time
Open the Teradici PCoIP Software Client, if this is the first time you have opened it you may be required to give the software permission to access your file system and microphone.

On first launch you will be presented with a screen asking for a **Host Address or Code** and a **Connection Name**.

In your web browser navigate to the details of the remote workstation you want to connect to and locate the Connect to IP address. This is the address that will be used by the Teradici PCoIP Software Client to connect to your remote workstation.

![Workstation details](/images/workstation_details.jpeg)

You can copy the **Connect to** IP address using the copy icon that appears next to the address on roll over.

This **Connect to** address should then be pasted into the **Host Address or Code** field on the Teradici PCoIP Software Client. Give this connection a name you will recognise in the **Connection Name** field (we recommend using the Sherpa project name or something similar).

Click the **SAVE** button and then the **NEXT** button.

All being well, you will be prompted for your Sherpa **username** and **password**.

Your **username** and **password** are the ones you supplied when signing up on the Sherpa website. Note that your username is **not** your email. If you have forgotten your username or password you can recover them using the Sherpa website.

Click **LOGIN** and The Teradici PCoIP Software Client will connect to your remote workstation. If you have been invited to multiple workstations you will be presented with a list. If you have only been invited to one workstation it will log you straight in.

The above shows a successful connection to a Linux Sherpa workstation.

## Subsequent connections to your workstation
Because you saved your connection, it will be available to you the next time you launch the Teradici software.

![Client saved connection](/images/client_saved_connection.jpeg)

Simply click on the Connection Name you chose for your project/workstation and enter your **username** and **password** when prompted. If you have been invited to multiple workstations you will be presented with a list. If you have only been invited to one workstation it will log you straight in.

## Logging out of your workstation
Do **not** use the disconnect option in the Teradici software. If you do, you will remain logged into your workstation, your workstation will be on and you will be charged.

When you have finished using your workstation make sure to log out or better still shut down your workstation.
